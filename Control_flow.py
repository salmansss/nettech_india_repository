# If the boolean expression evaluates to TRUE, then the block of statement(s) inside the if

# : symbol. If boolean expression evaluates to FALSE, then the first set of code after the
# end of block is executed

# Example CODE:

# var1 = 100

#     print("1 - Got a true expression value")
#     print(var1)
